    <h1>THE BEGINNING</h1>

    <p>
      Thorfinn is initially shown as an innocent, amiable child who is looking
      for adventure at the start of the series. He had a wonderful bond with his
      family and loved hearing Leif's tales of his travels. He was close to his
      father and greatly looked up to him, as is seen when he resolves to follow
      Thors by getting onto his boat to do so. This would serve as the impetus
      for Thorfinn's desire to exact his father's retribution. He eventually
      ends up joining Askeladds group and by that time he is a cold blooded guy
      because of all things he's seen from his young age. the rest of the first
      season. Thorfinn is a merciless guy. He's done so much wrong with the
      killing of inncoents and raping women. His biggest weakness is actully his
      abilty to not listen and his hotheadness. The only reason he's like thisis
      because he wants to fight Askeladd. He wants to avenge his father but near
      the end of the first season Askeladd dies be revealing his Welsh idenity
      and Thorfinn completely breaks down. He becomes unwilling to live

    <h2>SEASON 2</h2>
    <p>
      After plenty of waiting, the fans of popular
      <a href="https://www.vinlandsagamanga.net/" target="_blank">Manga</a>

      and anime Vinland saga revieced a second season. This is Thorfinns Slave
      Arc the show starts with a newly bought slave named Einar who was told to
      work with Thorfinn. (Thorfinn is still silent and unwilling to live)
      Anyway the entire show is how Einar and Throfinn are together and Thorfinn
      maturing. During his captivity, Thorfinn comes to the horrifying
      realization that his downfall was caused by the mile-long road of men he
      had slain in his quest to get revenge for the death of his father. He
      realizes he did so much wrong. Over time he starts to mature vastly, Its a
      very touching and eye opening season hence making it one of my favourite
      animes.
